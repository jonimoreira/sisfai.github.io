  <section class="introduction">
    <h2>Background and goals</h2>
    <p>In the Industry 4.0 era, digital enterprises generate and use vast amounts of data that are captured and stored at different locations to improve their business models by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI systems that rely on central data processing are not suitable in most applications since central data processing leads to issues on data accessibility, standardization, privacy, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, semantic interoperability plays a fundamental role in applications where data have become increasingly diverse and complex. AI systems may have biased or even potentially dangerous results if the meaning of data is not well understood.</p>
	<p>This workshop aims to address the semantic interoperability of federated data integration approaches for advanced analytics provided by AI applications that rely on different conditions for data accessibility. These approaches may include AI concerns on privacy, trust, resilience, digital ethics, law, and human rights and should follow the FAIR principles to foster not only higher levels of semantic interoperability but also findability, accessibility, and reusability.</p>

	<section class="subGuidelines">
	  <h2>Submission and publication</h2>
		<p>Papers can be submitted via the workshop website hosted on EasyChair (<a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sisfai2021">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sisfai2021</a>). Submitted papers should be in PDF format and follow the IEEE Proceedings Formatting Guideline (6-10 pages). The papers will be evaluated based on their scientific and technical contribution as well as their appropriateness, significance, and clarity by at least two members of the Program Committee. Each accepted paper that will be presented at the workshop must have one of its authors registered to EDOC’21 before the camera-ready deadline.</p>
		<p>Accepted and presented papers will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press in a workshop proceedings and made available through IEEE Xplore and the IEEE Digital Library. Selected papers will be invited to submit an extended version to the special issue on Privacy, Trust and Fairness in Data of MDPI's Applied Science journal.</p>
